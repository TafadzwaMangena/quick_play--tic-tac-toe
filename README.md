  ![Dialog](markdown/images/dialog.webp)

- ### Game Rules:

  1. Game Set-up: 
    - Board: Decide who will go first. The first player will be X and the second player will be O.
    - Players: There are two players, Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O".

  2. How to Play:
    - Starting the Game: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
    - Taking Turns: Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty cell on the grid. Player 1 (X) goes first, followed by Player 2 (O).
    - Marking the Grid: Click or tap on an empty cell to place your mark. Once placed, the mark cannot be moved or removed.

  3. Winning the Game: 
    - Winning Condition: A player wins the round if they are the first to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). There is no limit to the number of rounds you can play!
    - Draw: If all nine cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

  4. Ending the Game:
    - Declare Winner: Once a player has three marks in a row, the round ends, and that player is declared the winner of the round. You can decide how many rounds you can play.
    - Declare Draw: If all cells are filled without a winner, declare the game a draw.

  5. Optional Rules:
    - Rematch: After the game ends, players can choose to play again, switching who goes first.

It is my game design solution (not a bug) that players can play on as many rounds they wish to without a maximum number of rounds that can be played.

- ### Features to implement:

  - In the future I intend to add an option to play against a computer.
  - I intent to expand the game options where the user's can select which game mode they want to play, 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 tic tac toe.
  - It would be ideal for players to create their own profiles so they can track their progress and archivements.

## Design

- ### Color Scheme:

  - I chose Midnight Green, Blue Munsell, and White as the main colors for my website as the combination creates a visually appealing and effective color scheme.
  - The combination of Midnight Green, Blue Munsell, and White creates a harmonious and balanced color scheme. The deep green provides a solid foundation, the blue adds trustworthiness and clarity, and the white ensures simplicity and readability.
  - I chose to use Aqua and Grey as the main colors of the dialog to help user to focus on dialog.
  - Chartreuse and Orange are the mark ( "X" and "O") colors to give a vivid and bright impression.
  - The contrast between the dark and light colors is visually appealing and draws the viewer’s attention to key elements without being too stark or jarring.

  ![Web page Color Scheme](markdown/images/color-scheme.webp)

- ### Font:

  - Valera Round Google font is used as the main website font in order to increase visibility on the content in the website.
  - Times New Roman is used as the font on the buttons to differentiate them and make the content readible.
  - Verdana is the font used on the game grid due to it's bold weight and visibility.

## Bugs

- ### Solved Bugs
    
  1. The cell blocks were highlighting with the player's color when click. Only the player mark, (X) or (O) should have color.

  _Solution_: I removed the border on cell blocks to fix this bug.

  2. The Next Round and Restart Game button where still disabaled even after the round is finished. This error/ bug was caused by the fact that I was disabling the buttons after calling the checkWinner function, but the checkWinner function is enabling the buttons, causing the disabled buttons to enable and instantly disable.

  _Solution_: I added console logs on the buttons to check their interaction and now disabled the buttons from the checkWinner function to the updateCellBlock function.

  3. JShint warning/error "Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression." on score increament. 

  _Solution_: I replacement the ternary operator with an If statement. Currently on line 130 - 134 on JS.

- ### Unsolved Bugs

   1. None.  All discovered bugs were fixed. 

   - In case any bugs are discovered please flag on github.
