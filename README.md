## Design 

 - ### Color Scheme:

   - I chose Midnight Green, Blue Munsell, and White as the main colors for my website as the combination creates a visually appealing and effective color scheme.
   - The combination of Midnight Green, Blue Munsell, and White creates a harmonious and balanced color scheme. The deep green provides a solid foundation, the blue adds trustworthiness and clarity, and the white ensures simplicity and readability.
   - The contrast between the dark and light colors is visually appealing and draws the viewer’s attention to key elements without being too stark or jarring.

   COLOR SCHEME PIC

 - ### Font:

    - Valera Round Google font is used as the main website font in order to increase visibility on the content in the website.
    - Times New Roman is used as the font on the buttons to differentiate them and make the content readible.
    - Verdana is the font used on the game grid due to it's bold weight and visibility.
