                    One cool thing about Tic Tac Toe is that it's one of the simplest yet most effective illustrations
                    of the concept of a "zero-sum game" in game theory. In a zero-sum game, one player's gain is exactly
                    balanced by the losses of the other player. For Tic Tac Toe, this means that every advantage one
                    player gains directly results in a disadvantage for the other player.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, Tic Tac Toe can always end in a draw with optimal play from both players. The game has
                    been fully solved, meaning there is a known, mathematically optimal way to play for both the
                    starting player (X) and the second player (O). If both players play optimally, the game will always
                    result in a tie. This property makes it a fascinating study in strategy and game theory despite its
                    apparent simplicity.

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Board: </strong> Decide who will go first. The first player will be X and the second
                        player will be O.</li>
                    <li><strong>Players: </strong> There are two players, Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O".</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h2>How to Play:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Starting the Game: </strong> The game is played on a 3x3 grid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Taking Turns: </strong> Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty cell
                        on the grid. Player 1 (X) goes first, followed by Player 2 (O).</li>
                    <li><strong>Marking the Grid: </strong>Click or tap on an empty cell to place your mark. Once
                        placed,
                        the mark cannot be moved or removed.</li>

                <h2>Winning the Game: </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Winning Condition: </strong> A player wins if they are the first to get three of their
                        marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
                    <li><strong>Draw: </strong> If all nine cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the
                        game ends in a draw.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h2>Ending the Game: </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Declare Winner: </strong> Once a player has three marks in a row, the round ends, and
                        that player is declared the winner of the round. The first player to win 3 rounds has won the
                        game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Declare Draw: </strong> If all cells are filled without a winner, declare the game a
                        draw.</li>
